    <h1>Premier League Trophy</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Is there only one Trophy?</h2>
    <p>
      No, there are two Trophies which are identical and include an engraved base detailing past Premier League champions. During the season, one stays with the Premier League champions, while the other is used by the League.
    </p>
    <p>
      The champions must return their Trophy to the Premier League at least three weeks before their final league match of the season.
    </p>

    <h2>How big is the Trophy?</h2>
    <p>
      Each Trophy stands 3ft 5in (104cm) tall and is 2ft (61cm) wide. It weighs 4st (25.4kg) in total.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of that weight, the base into which the names of the champions are engraved comprises 2.5st (15.9kg).
    </p>

    <h2>What do the lions on the Trophy's handles represent?</h2>
    <p>
      The design of the Trophy is based on the theme of "The Three Lions of English Football". Two of the lions are above the handles on either side. When the captain of the title-winning team raises the Trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season, he becomes the third lion.
    </p>

    <h2>How many medals do the champions get?</h2>
    <p>
      The champions are given 40 commemorative medals made of silver, which are 2.25in (5.7cm) in diameter. They can be distributed to the manager, players and officials, as the club sees fit, as long as every player who has made at least five Premier League appearances during the title-winning season gets one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional medals may only be presented with the consent of the Premier League Board, and that will only be granted if more than 39 players have made at least five PL appearances during the campaign.
